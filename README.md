Since distributing full copies of textbooks without permission through a public GitHub repository violates copyright laws, I removed all PDF files.

This repository is archived and now serves as a reference of recommended textbooks about computer science and engineering, software engineering, programming, mathematics, machine learning and other related fields. While no longer actively maintained, the list is available as a resource for those looking for quality educational materials.
